    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Jakob Thompson, a driven student at BYU studying Strategic Management. This site shows my resume, projects, and some of my favorite skills I've been developing in IS201. I have aspirations of becoming a Mangement Consultant at Bain and Company, and have learned countless skills here in IS201. Many include my visualization ability in tableau, data analysis, and efficiency in articulating findings through SQL and other visualizations tools. Hope you enjoy everything!</p>
